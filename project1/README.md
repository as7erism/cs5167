# Cooker

A cooking tracking app.

## Design

The design was informed by sketches and two surveys.
Participants indicated a lack of time for cooking and a desire to track the ingredients in their pantry.
This necessitated a quick, responsive design with an ingredient tracker.

This was the proposed sketch:

Users liked the clean design but found it difficult to understand.

## Documentation

This app has two screens: the main page, and the goal tracking page.

More work will be done here in the future.
